# âŒšTetro Time ðŸŽ®

Warning: **WORK IN PROGRESS**, Not working yet ;)

## Overview

A tetris/tetromino based clock, timer and stopwatch for your **terminal**, which
displays the time using falling tetrominos. The rendering is using my
[PixelLoop](https://crates.io/crates/pixel_loop) engine. If you are interested
in the development of this and other projects check out my YouTube channel
[MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/mrjakob), where I live code this and other
projects.


## Build Instructions

To build the project use `cargo`:

```shell
cargo build --release
```


## Usage

Once built, run the `target/release/tetrotime` binary to start the clock/timer
